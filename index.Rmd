## Normal Distribution
 
The normal (or Gaussian) distribution is defined as follows:
 
$$latex
f(x;\mu,\sigma^2) = \frac{1}{\sigma\sqrt{2\pi}} 
e^{ -\frac{1}{2}\left(\frac{x-\mu}{\sigma}\right)^2 }
$$

## Density Plot
 
To generate random draws from a normal distribution we use the **rnorm** function:
 
```{r block1}
output <- rnorm(1000, 100, 15);
```

## Bell Shape
 
The normal distribution has the typical bell shape:
 
```{r block2, fig.width=8, fig.height=5}
library(ggplot2)
qplot(output)
```

## Kernel density estimation
 
We can perform density estimation on the sample:
 
```{r block3, fig.width=8, fig.height=5}
plot(density(output))
```
